type Store interface { //keeping a strict separation between the layers of your service is the biggest benefit of having store interface.
	//So like, your methods of your service shouldn't know anything about your database,
	//they shouldn't rely on a database implementation. Nothing in your service should be dependent on your implementation details.
	//The other benefit of having store interface is certainly that you can switch between databases that fulfill your store interface.
